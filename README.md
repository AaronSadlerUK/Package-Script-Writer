## Testing the API

To test the api, there is a self-documenting script which relies on the [Rest Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) VSCode Extension, or you can use POSTMan. You will need to use VS Code, and run the site using the following

    dotnet watch run --project .\PSW\PSW\

And then opening the file Api Request/API Testing.http file
