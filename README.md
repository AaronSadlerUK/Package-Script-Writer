# Package-Script-Writer

This is the code repository for the Package Script Writer website. 

[https://psw.codeshare.co.uk](https://psw.codeshare.co.uk/)

The site is built in ASP.NET Core 6.

There is no database so it is very easy to get up and running. 

You need to have the .NET 6 SDK installed first.

Just fork the repository, clone it to your machine and then open the solution file and run the project or navigate to the PSW folder with all the files in and run the site using the command dotnet run
